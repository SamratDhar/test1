Edinburgh is bidding goodbye to its very own International Fringe Festival and one of the warmest Scottish summers, however the festival rings do not seems to stand still as we gear up to welcome Goddess Durga at Edinburgh Durgotsav this autumn. The autumn clouds and gentle breeze call for the festive period again, the countdown begins, 40 (or 39) days to go…

It’s raining heavily back in Kolkata, the lanes, streets are water logged providing a feel of Venice in the City. The local puja committees are on their toes to start of the things. Nature may not be pleasant now in rain drenched Bengal, however it’s so charming now a days here at the end of Scottish summer in Scotland. The blooming autumn flowers and the gentle breeze are reverberating the Durgatsav tunes. At the helm of globalization, the Bengali diaspora has its presence at every corners of the world, thus the charm and spread of Durgapuja is not limited to Bengal or India anymore, it is global truly. Edinburgh too is not been behind, starting 2014, Edinburgh Durgatsav is in its 4th year this autumn is ready to spread happiness and joy.
Scottish Association of Bengali Arts and Sanskritik Heritage (SABASH) welcomes you at the Edinburgh Durgotsav on its 4th year. Along with worshiping Devi Durga, we would indulge into cultural activities, music, food and gossips to celebrate the Bengali diaspora and heritage.
